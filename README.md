This is my first React project.  &nbsp;It features a NavBar by Material UI v4. 
<br>  It takes the idea of a pet adoption site and a fantasy game and
combines the two. <br>Just create your player name and enter the site.&nbsp;
You can choose your Army from list of Knights and Dragons.
 &nbsp;Choose your favorites,&nbsp;add or remove them from your Army.
